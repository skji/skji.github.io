Finnally I find time to change the layouts of my github blog and make it more beautiful. Jekyll and bootstrap are good things. I wish my writing and coding better and better and I could finish my game project on time and study Japanese well.

I love emacs and github.

The songs in Frozen are so amazing. Let it go!
