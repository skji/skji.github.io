Tokyo met the heaviest snow in the past 20 years today. I had a
wonderful day, built snowman with Lingyun Wang and sang songs, then
missed the train back to Shinjuku. Helped by two Taiwanese and two
Mainland friends who I had been with the first time, I travelled to a
strange station and switched metro back home. People are so kind, I
appreciate them so much.

Wish a better life.
