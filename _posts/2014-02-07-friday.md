It's Friday today! Gesus! I had been thinking it as Thursday all day
long. So weekend is coming. Times flies!

However, I have a lot of things to do. I need more time to work on my
project.

The
[hacking keyboard](http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/B000EXXEWE/ref=s9_simh_gw_p147_d0_i1?pf_rd_m=AN1VRQENFRJN5&pf_rd_s=center-2&pf_rd_r=0VFBE72XWWFVA1HMEY9M&pf_rd_t=101&pf_rd_p=155416469&pf_rd_i=489986)
is cool but a little expensive for me. I need more money to buy the
things I like.

I don't have dating tomorrow. So I should focus on the project and
work hard. I hope that time could be slowed down.
